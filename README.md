# Optical Lever Sensitivity Calibration

## Description
A streamlit app developed for determining optical lever sensitivity. The app is made to work with a standard output file from HEKA patchmaster but can be repurposed for other formats if needed. Contact me if you have any questions!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher. It may work with other versions but I have not tested it.

git clone https://github.com/neuro-myoung/invols.git
```

Create a local virtual environment, activate it, and install the requried packages using either

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
